## Introduction

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, to help developers manage code and collaborate on projects. Whether you're working solo or with a team, GitHub provides tools and features that streamline the development process.

This guide will cover the basics of using GitHub, from setting up your first repository to collaborating with others.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before using GitHub, you need to install Git on your local machine:

- **Windows:** Download and install Git from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **Mac:** Use Homebrew: `brew install git`
- **Linux:** Use your package manager: `sudo apt-get install git`

After installation, configure Git with your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
